**Call to Order**

Brian Behlendorf (BB) called the meeting to order at 8:02 am Pacific Time, and Jory Burson (JB) recorded the minutes. A quorum of Governing Board Members was established for the conduct of business, and the  meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business.

**Agenda**

BB introduced the agenda for the meeting. There were no additional topics added.

 

**Antitrust Policy Notice**

BB reminded the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation [antitrust policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy) notice to which all meetings must adhere.

**Introductions**

BB welcomed TAC Representatives who have been invited to join the non-executive sessions of OpenSSF Governing Board meetings. BB also introduced Sam Ramji, who has been contracted to assist OpenSSF staff with strategic planning and coordination activities to prepare for 2023. 

**Meeting Rules Update**

Chairperson Thomas shared changes to the operation of Governing Board meetings in order to improve participation and efficiency. Moving forward: agenda items will be timeboxed; Governing Board members will be given first opportunity to speak on issues, followed by Invited Guests and then Observers with time permitting; and the Zoom chat will be disabled to prevent the loss of key points outside the meeting. 

**2022 Timeline and Milestones**

BB shared a timeline and workback plan for achieving the remaining milestones OpenSSF needs to accomplish in 2022. BB further noted that the agenda development and preparation of other documents for the Nov. 11 strategy meeting is a primary focus in order to ensure Board members are aligned on the open questions and able to fully participate in discussions. 

ACTION: OpenSSF Staff will include information about financial investments and results for the Board in the November meeting. 

**Governing Board and TAC Q&A**

Representative Callaway presented an update from the TAC, noting recent progress, highlights, and areas of improvement. He noted that organic activity and output from the working groups, projects, and SIGs remains high and of high quality. He cited recent publications from working groups that are providing good guidance for general and ecosystem-specific work, as well as the projects such as Scorecard which has been on a regular release cadence and has been picking up a lot of new adoption. He further highlighted some of the impactful work going on in new and existing working groups. Representative Callaway described the areas of improvement as issues of scope and identity - who we (the TAC) are and what our direction should be, understanding the TAC’s role in conversations and as well as the Mobilization Plan. Representative Callaway then shared some ideas the TAC has been considering in order to improve communication and efficiency of operations.

**Governance Subcommittee Updates**

Observer Bertucio gave a brief update on the progress of the governance subcommittee’s work. She shared some of the recommendations for the composition of the committee and noted that the next steps are to provide a proposal and resolution for the Governing Board to consider via email. She also noted that the group has been working on suggestions for the Nov. 11 meeting discussions. 

**Getting to Consensus on the Mobilization Plan**

BB introduced the next topic, getting to consensus on the mobilization plan, noting that the goal was to outline the process through which the group can reach agreement. BB asked what information or variables would be most useful to help the group consider and reach consensus to proceed with Mobilization Plan activities, funding and resourcing. BB also suggested that the Governing Board task the Governance Subcommittee to develop a proposal. 

BB also gave a quick update on the status of different Mobilization Plan work areas, noting that 4 SIGs have been formed and are actively delivering work. It was further noted that some of the workstreams were more aspirational than others, and that the seeming lack of progress on those workstreams is more reflective of their readiness to come forward with funding proposals. 

ACTION: OpenSSF Staff will provide a short slide with future meeting materials outlining status updates on Mobilization Plan activities. 

ACTION: Governance Subcommittee will develop a proposal for building consensus and oversight of Mobilization Plan activities. 

**EXECUTIVE SESSION**

BB called the open session of the OpenSSF Governing Board meeting to a close. TAC Representatives and invited guests were excused.** **

Special Topic: Government Relations**

BB invited Observer Borek to present on Government Relations and the recent activities of the OpenSSF Public Policy committee. 

ACTION: Governing Board members are asked to read the group’s [recent blog](https://openssf.org/blog/2022/09/27/the-united-states-securing-open-source-software-act-what-you-need-to-know/) about understanding the new Securing Open Source Software Act and to send representatives from their organizations to the Public Policy committee.

**Staffing: Current Headcount and Open Positions**

BB shared a table overview of current and future staffing. BB noted several roles which have job descriptions in development. BB noted the high priority hires for 2023 focus on program and project management that will help grow our support for our working groups and the Mobilization Plan workstreams. 

ACTION: Board members are asked to share their thoughts and input for the continued budgeting and resourcing discussion in November.

**Governance Changes and Input into Nov. 11 Meeting**

Sam Ramji (SR) shared a plan to meet with each Governing Board member and help get the different voices and perspectives of the Board into one set of documents in order to prepare for the November 11 strategy meeting and 2023 planning.
