**Governance updates**

OA presented slides on how to improve our governance, standardization, and mobilization plan as the next set of interesting work that doesn’t have funding yet.	

OA offered a case study on OpenSSF’s inability to submit a position on CISA Self-Attestation public input request as an example of the need for improved structure and planning.

**TAC Updates**

TAC representative CRob presented working group updates for identifying security threats, GUAC, and progress on the sterling toolchain.

The GUAC project moved into the incubation phase as part of the supply chain integrity working group.

Sterling Toolchain details can be found here - [https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/tree/main/SecurityToolbelt](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/tree/main/SecurityToolbelt)

**Public Policy Committee Recommendations**

Brian Behlendorf (BB) presented the Public Policy committee's proposal. The Committee asks the Governing Board for a budget of $20k (as a variance to the current budget, and to be administered by OpenSSF staff) for content development. This will assist the Committee in the timely preparation of responses to RFCs, blog posts, white papers, or other public publications, which by the current charter, will continue to require GB approval.

Discussion ensued, and the committee will come back with proposed changes to the charter to address the reporting.

**AI: Comeback with a list of what the PPC will be responsible for once the charter is approved by the GB - BB**

# Welcome & Call to Order [6 min]

    * Stephen Walli motioned to approve.
    * CRob seconded the motion. 
    * All in favor.

    * Andrew van der Stock motioned to approve.
    * CRob seconded the motion. 
    * All in favor.

**Note that discussion from alternates occurred while primary representatives were present, which resulted in our agenda falling behind schedule. **


## General Information


### General Updates & Discussion

OA noted the London meetup being postponed, OpenSSF Day EU keynote speaker selection, and dates for other upcoming events as well as outlining other strategic changes and communications briefly.


### AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC)

OA presented details for the competition and OpenSSF’s advisory role (clarified to be vendors selected by OpenSSF). The process for brand approval was discussed with notes from the charter and the NDA for reference. A proposal for members to help refine the brand approval process, which is a recommendation from the GC. The recommendation from the GC was tabled.

Concerns that Staff cannot share information with the GB though Staff attempted to get GB clearance on the NDA and were denied. Jim Z asked for clarification on whether the challenge is problematic or if the process was questionable. Proposed skipping opportunities where the GB is not able to be informed beforehand rather than taking time to refine the process. Eric Brewer mentioned that there is a middle ground and not all opportunities should be skipped.

Members see value in the brand alignment with this type of work so rather than skip similar opportunities proposing that more push be made to inform the GB about these efforts in some detail prior to decisions being made.

There is an AI/LLM/ML group forming atm.  Originally their scope was too broad, but they've done some homework and will return to consideration for adoption in September  [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/175](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/175)     [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/188](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/188)

Summary: The GC recommendation on a brand approval process was raised to the GB. The GB tabled the recommendation in that it was viewed narrowly toward the AIxCC initiative. It was determined that creating a brand oversight process for these edge cases would be a more difficult effort than it is worth considering. The result is that there does not need to be a brand oversight process for general use cases or edge use cases.


### Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) RFI

OA presented the details on the request for public comment, including the tight timeline with no GB prior to the deadline. Members are interested in participating with the Staff and creating the RFI but would like the ability for GB to review/comment. 

Volunteers: Eric Brewer, Andrew van der Stock, Ryan Ware, Brian Fox, Stephen Chin, Stephen Walli, Vincent Danen, Mike Hanley (would also like TAC involved), Sarah Evans from Dell, CRob, Jonathan Meadows



* RESOLVED: Approve a temporary committee of the board that has delegated authority to respond to the ONCD RFI in collaboration with LF Staff.
    * Stephen Chin motioned to approve.
    * Stephen Walli seconded the motion.  
    * All in favor.


### Subway Map: Governance

OA presented completed and upcoming governance work to highlight accomplishments and opened for questions on the continued strategy.


### Subway Map: OpenSSF Prioritization

OA presented current and upcoming work on Prioritization efforts. No questions.


### White House Open Source Software Security Summit

OA presented the goals and next steps for the summit. Request to review related documents to ensure transparency on what will be discussed. Call for Premier members to nominate their attendees to determine capacity ASAP, given the short timeline. The agenda will be sent for review after this meeting.

Ms. Anne Neuberger is confirmed on the agenda; no other White House participants are known. 

It would be nice to know their definition of critical infrastructure. Harry mentioned that they have defined that. [https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) 

**ACTION ITEM: Look into hotel block for attendees**


### SSP, OpenSSF

OA apologized for the communication blunder and requested a fact-based conversation about the issue. Highlights the struggle with operational-based projects and the desire for a new home for other projects. At this point, all conversations have been informal. 

Discussion ensued on the desire to put our house in order and the organizations to be complementary. The issue with limiting the scope of OpenSSF to SCS seen as accommodating SSP. OA is open to adjusting wording, but the intent was to gather member input on the formation of SSP to complement OpenSSF’s mission. A funding story needs to be developed. 

 \
Request on behalf of the individual contributors of our membership that some public statements/clarification be provided to ease confusion and give more information/clarity.

There is a desire to understand why projects are hesitant to join OpenSSF. Small informal committee recommended to investigate root issues.

Volunteers:



* Sarah Evans
* Eric Brewer
* Stephen Walli
* Brian Fox
* Ryan Ware


## TAC Updates

CRob agreed to asynchronous review of TAC updates due to being over time and stated that there was no additional information to share beyond what is contained in the slide.


## Associate Membership Process

DM stated that, due to being over time, the vote to approve the Associate Membership Process would be conducted by electronic vote.


    RESOLVED: That the above process is adopted and carried into the minutes for Associate Membership and carried forward with the next update to the GB occurring Jan 2024 with requirements and suggested renewals.

**ACTION ITEM: Have electronic vote**
