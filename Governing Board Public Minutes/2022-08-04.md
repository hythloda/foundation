**Call to Order**

Brian Behlendorf (BB) called the meeting to order at 8:04 am Pacific Time, and Jenn Bonner (JBonn) recorded the minutes. A quorum of Governing Board Members was established for the conduct of business, and the  meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business.

**Agenda**

BB introduced the agenda for the meeting. There were no additional topics added.

 

**Antitrust Policy Notice**

BB reminded the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation [antitrust policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy) notice to which all meetings must adhere.

**Introductions**

BB introduced new Governing Board Member Scott Roberts from Coinbase, and new Governing Board Member Stephen Augustus from Cisco. 

**Approval of Governing Board Minutes**

The Governing Board discussed the minutes from the meeting on 5 May 2022 and 2 June 2022. 

BB called for a motion to approve the minutes of the 5 May 2022 and 2 June 2022 meetings of the Governing Board. The motion passed with no representatives objecting or abstaining. 

**Report out from recent US government meetings**

The Governing Board discussed Jim Zemlin’s (JZ) recent meeting on cybersecurity labor force challenges. The issues presented were focused on cybersecurity talent overall and not specific to open source. 

A small roundtable discussion was also held with the Cyber Safety Review Board CSRB leadership and staff, as well as a small group of leaders (CISO) from large organizations such as Pfizer, Metlife, etc. The purpose was to review the [log4j response](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CSRB-Report-on-Log4-July-11-2022_508.pdf) and understand how industry could better adopt its recommendations. The CSRB’s read out from the meeting was comprehensive and developed by government and private sector stakeholders. 

The CSRB report mentioned OpenSSF 29 times in both recommendations and citations, and specifically mentioned OpenSSF in 7 out of the 19 recommendations from the report. End user participants emphasized the need for better software bill of materials (SBOM) data both within their enterprises and from third-party vendors.

There was agreement among the Governing Board to review the 19 CSRB report recommendations and compare alongside the [Mobilization Plan](https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/) work streams. Two key topics noted in both the CSRB report and the OpenSSF Mobilization Plan include SBOMs (how to deploy and take advantage of more sophisticated tooling) and Scorecards (which aspects to consume, and which to defer).

**Refining OpenSSF Governance and Policies**

The Governing Board held a discussion with an aim to encourage alignment and more transparent and constructive discussions between the Governing Board and the Technical Advisory Council (TAC). 

A proposal was raised to increase the transparency of Governing Board goals within the TAC by enabling more direct communication and collaboration between the TAC and the Governing Board via two avenues: 1) publish a public form of the Governing Board meeting minutes, and 2) establish a Governing Board subcommittee to work with the TAC. This group would be able to make recommendations to the Governing Board. 

The proposal further states that the TAC should operate as a validation group for new proposals and use of OpenSSF resources. Specifically, the TAC would be tasked with validating (but not funding) proposed projects, whereas the Governing Board is tasked with directly (or indirectly) funding proposed projects (but not necessarily conferring or validating technical alignment). 

The proposal would not change the Governing Board’s authority to approve funding decisions, but would enable the Governing Board to delegate classes of decisions (e.g. small grants administered by OpenSSF). For example, OpenSSF would be able to connect validated proposals to potential funding, after the TAC provides its advisory recommendation. OpenSSF  will provide support through project management, and the TAC would review the cadence/reporting, and funding logistics. The projects that are funded would then fall under the TAC’s continued oversight, which is intended to help with alignment, and enables the community to identify support in new areas of need. The proposal states that the TAC would oversee progress and outcomes, using funding recommendations as a lever to pursue productive outcomes. 

The intended result of the proposal is to increase early awareness of Governing Board efforts and activities among TAC members and vice-versa. Discussion ensued on ways the subcommittee could approach funding various needs for projects, and the additional time and bandwidth required of participants.

There was general consensus to publish a public version of the Governing Board minutes starting with this meeting and going forward under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). 

Governing Board members confirmed that the next step is to convert this informal proposal shared into a formal documented proposal (governance document) for the Governing Board to vote on and approve.

A motion was raised to approve the formation of a Governing Board subcommittee to work with the TAC, and make proposals as needed to the Governing Board. The motion passed with no representatives objecting or abstaining. 

ACTION: OpenSSF will work on setting up the approved Governing Board subcommittee.

The Governing Board discussed potentially expanding the size of the TAC. The concern raised was that the relative size of the TAC is small compared to the size of the Governing Board and the scope of OpenSSF. The TAC is currently comprised of 7 members: 4 members who are elected by contributors to the OpenSSF Community, and 3 members who are appointed by the Governing Board. Discussion ensued on an appropriate size for the TAC, and ideas on size relative to speed and evoking thoughtful discussions and timely decision making. There was general agreement that this issue can be researched further within the new Governing Board subcommittee. 

The Governing Board reviewed and discussed the slides related to the clarified mission of the TAC. 

The clarified mission also aims to meet projects where they’re at, and not require wholesale adoption of OpenSSF hosted infrastructure. The goal, rather, is to strike a balance between helping projects make improvements while adopting OpenSSF infrastructure where it makes sense. 

The Governing Board also discussed engaging maintainers and users. Governing Board members expressed an interest in seeing more end user and consumer language, and modifying existing language to clarify OpenSSF’s objectives for them.

The Governing Board discussed the current activities of the TAC related to working with maintainers. The proposal includes changes that make it more explicit that the TAC take maintainer input much more directly and address the diversity of the projects OpenSSF intends to serve. There was agreement that additional efforts can be made to improve collaboration and connection with maintainers. 

The next step will be to iterate on the subcommittee proposal and come back to the Governing Board for approval. Volunteers put their names forward to serve on the subcommittee. The subcommittee will come forward with a proposal ideally for the next meeting. Much appreciation was expressed for the efforts to prepare for, and hold, the discussion today.

**2022 Budget Refresh**

The prior topic on the agenda did not leave enough time to address the budget, and the topic would be addressed over email between meetings. 

**Adjournment**

The meeting of the Governing Board adjourned at 9:24am US Pacific Time.
