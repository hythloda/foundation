**Call to Order**

Brian Behlendorf (BB) called the meeting to order at 10:02 am Pacific Time, and Jenn Bonner (JBonn) recorded the minutes. A quorum of Governing Board Members was established for the conduct of business, and the meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business.

**Agenda**

BB introduced the agenda for the meeting. There were no additional topics added.

 

**Antitrust Policy Notice**

BB reminded the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation antitrust policy notice to which all meetings must adhere.

**Introductions**

BB reviewed the current Governing Board Directory. 

BB introduced the following new Governing Board members: Dr. Kai Chen, Huawei and Clyde Rodriguez, Meta.

**Approval of Governing Board Minutes**

In order to reduce email traffic, BB stated that going forward, meeting minutes will be approved during the meeting rather than via email. The meeting minutes will continue to be distributed via email for review; approval will take place during the subsequent meeting. 

BB called for a motion to approve the minutes of the December 2, 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. Andrew van der Stock motioned to approve the minutes and Steve Chin seconded the motion. The motion passed with no representatives objecting or abstaining. 

**Review and Approve Updated Charter**

BB reviewed the updates to the Charter. The Charter was updated to correct the number of Technical Advisory Committee members elected by the community (4) and appointed by Governing Board (3), which also reflects previous Board discussions. Additionally, clarification was added for the terms “TAC Representative” and “Security Community Individual Representative”, and a Board Observer role and function was added to the Charter. 

BB asked for a motion to approve the amended OpenSSF Participation Agreement and Charter, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. Steve Chin motioned to approve the amended OpenSSF Participation Agreement and Charter and Andrew van der Stock seconded the motion. The motion passed with no representatives objecting or abstaining. 

**Update on Alpha-Omega**

BB gave a brief update on Project Alpha-Omega. The Board agreed to delay a public blog announcement targeted for release on January 10, until after the upcoming White House meeting. The blog will be circulated to the Board prior to release, but Board approval is not required. 

Job postings for product managers and software developers are in-process.

BB encouraged Governing Board members to put forward names for the Board Committees.  

**White House Software Security Summit**

BB introduced the topic for discussion and shared that OpenSSF, along with the Linux Foundation and several OpenSSF members, has been invited to attend a one-day in-person and virtual discussion on software security on January 13, hosted by Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology. Approximately 50 people will attend the White House Software Security Summit, three from each invited organization.

BB shared OpenSSF’s goals for the meeting.

John Andrukonis (JA) offered to provide the LF with an introduction to Akamai. Neil Allen (NA) noted that Jen Easterly previously worked at Morgan Stanley and offered to set up a meeting BB. 

BB shared the agenda for the White House Security Summit, and will send the agenda to the GB email list so that Governing Board members can further review. 

Governing Board members shared whether they were attending the White House Security Summit, and who from their offices would be attending.

BB stressed that OpenSSF’s strategy will be to position Open SSF as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span> key organization that the executive branch, and other government actors, can and should work with on OSS supply chain security. There will also be an effort to drive government funding - from small grants to a moonshot - into OpenSSF funding opportunities and related efforts. OpenSSF will work to refute the myth of open source as done by volunteer charity workers., and make it clear that industry has come together with the right strategy, and that it’s time for government to match or exceed current commitments. 

BB shared OpenSSF’s key messages, including: 



* Open source software is now critical infrastructure. 
* OpenSSF’s programs work to quantify and mitigate security risk in the OSS supply chain through:
    * Better developer tools
    * Technical specifications
    * Education and guidance
    * Direct relationships with open source maintainers
    * Continued adoption
* OpenSSF is already identifying the most important and at-risk OSS projects, and is already delivering improvements to them.
* The public sector has a unique and meaningful role to play as both consumer and producer of OSS, through:
    * Procurement policy
    * Funding
    * Data-sharing
* OpenSSF has “shovel-ready” programs and relationships that can be leveraged to drive substantial impact. 
* OpenSSF has already pulled together the key commercial partners, non-profit partners, and expert open source security community, to address this crisis.

BB also shared a list of pre-meeting deliverables, including a non-public letter from the OpenSSF Governing Board to the NSC (Anne Neuberger). The Board would like to review the letter by Sunday evening. 

**Any Other Business**

BB thanked everyone for attending the meeting, and encouraged everyone  to take a look at the additional information provided in the slide deck. 

**Adjournment**

BB called the meeting to a close and the meeting of the Governing Board adjourned at 11:01 AM Pacific Time.
